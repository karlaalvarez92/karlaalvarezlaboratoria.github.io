      aboutMe: [
        "My name is Karla Alvarez and I am a self-taught Front-End developer. I just graduated from Laboratoria where I learned intensively in 6 months to design WebApps and work with agile methodologies. I want to continue developing my skills as a programmer and also become Fullstack, also, I would love to become a Scrum Master. ",
        "After learning, my greatest passion is to create. Before being a programmer I made a living teaching ballet and as a saleswoman, with these two activities I discovered and developed most of my soft skills. I have the pleasure and ease of learning on my own or with a guide, to communicate my ideas, to work as a team, to speak in public and to teach. I really enjoy creating connection with people and learning from everything around me. "
