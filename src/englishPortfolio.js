      aboutMe: [
        "My name is Karla Alvarez and I am a self-taught Front-End developer. I recently graduated from Laboratoria where I learned how to design WebApps and work with agile methodologies throughout the intensive 6-month bootcamp.  I want to continue developing my skills as a programmer and also become Fullstack.  Iâ€™m planning on becoming a Scrum Master. ",
        "After learning, my greatest passion is creating. Before being a programmer, I made a living by teaching ballet and as a saleswoman; with these two activities I discovered and developed most of my soft skills. I have the pleasure and ease of learning on my own or with guidance,  communicating my ideas,  working as a team,  speaking in public and  teaching. I really enjoy building connections with people and learning from everything around me. "
